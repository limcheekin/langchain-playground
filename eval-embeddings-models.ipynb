      "\n",
      "Retriever: e5-large-v2.pkl\n",
      "1) The core of Flutter’s layout mechanism is widgets. In Flutter, almost\n",
      "everything is a widget—even layout models are widgets.\n",
      "The images, icons, and text that you see in a Flutter app  are all widgets.\n",
      "But things you don’t see are also widgets, such as the rows, columns,\n",
      "and grids that arrange, constrain, and align the visible widgets.\n",
      "2) This approach relies on certain characteristics of a language runtime (in\n",
      "particular, fast object instantiation and deletion). Fortunately, Dart is\n",
      "particularly well suited for this\n",
      "task.\n",
      "\n",

      "As mentioned, Flutter emphasizes widgets as a unit of composition. Widgets are\n",
      "the building blocks of a Flutter app’s user interface, and each widget is an\n",
      "immutable declaration of part of the user interface.\n",
      "3) In Flutter, almost everything is a Widget.\n",

      "\n",
      "Retriever: e5-large-v2.pkl\n",
      "1) The important difference between stateless and stateful\n",
      "widgets is that StatefulWidgets have a State object\n",
      "that stores state data and carries it over\n",
      "across tree rebuilds, so it’s not lost.\n",
      "2) This is where the concept of Stateful vs Stateless widgets comes from.\n",
      "A StatelessWidget is just what it sounds like—\n",
      "a widget with no state information.\n",
      "\n",
      "StatelessWidgets are useful when the part of the user interface\n",
      "you are describing doesn’t depend on anything\n",
      "other than the configuration information in the object.\n",
      "3) When writing an app, you’ll use two types of widgets:\n",
      "StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget.\n",
      "A StatelessWidget is just what it sounds like—a\n",
      "widget with no state. A StatelessWidget is created once,\n",
      "and never changes its appearance.\n",
      "A StatefulWidget dynamically changes state based on data\n",
      "received, or user input.\n",

      "you can supply a TextEditingController\n",
      "to retrieve user input:\n",
      "2) In Flutter, you pass through an InputDecoration object to the\n",
      "decoration constructor for the text widget.\n",
      "\n",

      "you might be wondering how user input fits into the picture.\n",
      "In UIKit, you usually query the widgets for their current values\n",
      "when it’s time to submit the user input, or action on it.\n",
