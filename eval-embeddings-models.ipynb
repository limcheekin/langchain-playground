      "\n",
      "You can use a real device or the Emulator to test a app link,\n",
      "but first make sure you have executed flutter run at least once on\n",

      "To test only the app setup, use the adb command:\n",

      "Note:\n",
      "   This does not test whether the web files are hosted correctly, the command launches the app even\n",
      "   if web files are not presented.\n",

      "test the counter app produced by the flutter create\n",
      "command. This app allows a user to tap on a button\n",
      "to increase a counter.\n",

      "2. Add the integration_test dependency\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, use the integration_test and flutter_test packages\n",
      "to write integration tests. Add these dependencies to the dev_dependencies\n",
      "section of the app’s pubspec.yaml file, specifying the Flutter SDK as the\n",
      "location of the package.\n",
      "4) During a typical development cycle,\n",

      "you’ll need to set up physical device deployment in Xcode\n",
      "and an Apple Developer account. If your app is using Flutter plugins,\n",
      "you will also need the third-party CocoaPods dependency manager.\n",
      "2) Build the app for deployment using the\n",

      "by using the --web-renderer option (See Web renderers).\n",
